`BMix` provides univariate Binomial and Beta-Binomial mixture models, as well as mixtures that combine both type of distributions. Count-based mixtures can be used in a variety of settings, for instance to model genome sequencing data of somatic mutations in diseases such as cancer.

`BMix` fits these mixtures by maximum likelihood exploiting the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Model selection for the number of mixture components is carried out using the Integrated Classification Likelihood, an extension of the Bayesian Information Criterion that accounts for the entropy of the latent variables.

`BMix` is part of the `evoverse`, a package that gathers multiple R packages to implement 
Cancer Evolution analyses; see more [about evoverse](https://caravagn.github.io/evoverse).
