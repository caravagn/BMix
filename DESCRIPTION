Description: BMix provides univariate Binomial and Beta-Binomial mixture models, as well as 
    mixtures that combine both type of distributions. BMix fits these mixtures by maximum likelihood
    exploiting the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Model selection for the number of mixture 
    components is carried out using the Integrated Classification Likelihood, an extension of the
    Bayesian Information Criterion that accounts for the entropy of the latent variables.
