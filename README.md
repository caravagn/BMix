Binomial and Beta-Binomial mixture models.


This package provides the implementation of Binomial and Beta-Binomial mixture models via maximum likelihood and the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Model selection is carried out using the Integrative Classification Likelihood, and extension of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) with entropy of the latent variables.
